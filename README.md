A Simple use departmental calendar as a practice project to strengthen C fundamentals.

This is a simple but very useful practice program for strengthening the C programming fundamentals. It works like a departmental calendar where one can view monthly calendars, check upcoming events, see all stored events, filter events by month, and add new ones. This program uses basic but important concepts of C, such as structures, arrays, functions, loops, conditionals, string handling, and the time.h library to check the current date. Everything is combined into a menu-driven format to interact with the program easily.

The code starts with the inclusion of required header files: stdio.h for input and output, string.h for handling strings, and time.h to access the system's current date. It then declares a structure named Event. This structure contains the basic information about each event: the day of the month, the number of the month, and the name of the event stored as a character array. An array of this structure will later be used to store multiple events.

A significant part of this project is the printMonth function, which prints the calendar for any month of the year 2026. The function takes three parameters: the name of the month, the total number of days in that month, and which day of the week the month starts on. It then prints the header of the month and names of the days of the week before it places the correct number of blank spaces until the first actual date falls underneath the proper day of the week. Finally, it will print out all the dates in a neat grid format, moving to a new line whenever a week completes.

Another important feature is the notification system, handled by the checkNotifications function. Every time the menu is shown, this function gets today’s day and month using the system clock. It then compares them with each stored event. If any event matches today’s date, it prints a notification. If not, it simply displays that there are no events scheduled for today. This gives the program a more realistic and useful feel.

Inside the main function, it creates an array of 100 Event structures. The program starts with 12 pre-defined events, like Republic Day, Sports Day, Teachers’ Day, and exam dates. These events serve as the default database. Following this, the program enters a loop, continuing to run until the user chooses to exit. Each time the loop starts, the notification function is called so that the user is always informed of any events happening on the current date.

This menu has five options: the first one prints the calendar of an arbitrary month of 2026. It selects the proper starting weekday and a number of days according to user input (1–12), then calls the printMonth function. The second option simply lists all the stored events with their day, month, and event name. The third option allows the user to list events belonging to one of the months. The program asks for a number of the month, and then goes through all the events, printing only those that belong to the selected month.

The fourth option includes adding a new event by asking for a day, month, and the name of the event. This option also includes very careful input validation. If the month is not between 1 and 12, or if the day is more than the amount that is allowed in that particular month, it shows an error and doesn't save the event. If the input is valid, the event is added into the array and the event count goes up. Finally, the fifth option exits the program nicely.
This Departmental Calendar Project is, in fact, a comprehensive mini-application that shows how several C concepts can be combined to form a useful tool. For beginners, this will help them understand structures, arrays, string input, functions with parameters, date handling, and menu-driven programming-simply and practically. Further refinements could be made to it, like saving events in files, color in the console, or support for multiple years. That is why this is an excellent learning exercise for gaining confidence in programming with C.
